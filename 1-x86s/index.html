        <p>Welcome to the <em>very first</em> issue of Tangled Bits!
Those last few weeks have been fairly interesting for the system world, most
notably with announcement of a design proposal for a long awaited simplified x86
architecture by Intel, new moves toward confidential computing from AWS, Google
Cloud, and Azure, and the announcement of OSDI 2023 papers.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-x86s">Introducing x86S</h2>
<p>Intel <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/envisioning-future-simplified-architecture.html">published</a>
a proposal describing its take at a simplification of the x86-64 architecture,
mostly focusing on the removal of legacy operation modes and support for xAPIC.
The complete proposal can be downloaded <a href="https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/776648">here</a>.</p>
<p>The x86-64 architectures was introduced by AMD in 2000, and at the opposite of
Intel's own 64-bits architecture, Itanium, the x86-64 architecture is backward
compatible with previous x86 processors.
Back in the days, Intel quickly realized (the hard way) that backward
compatibility was a crucial feature during the transition from 32-bits to
64-bits systems, and quickly aligned with AMD on the x86-64 architecture we use
today.
But those days are now far behind and the transition to 64-bits is mostly over,
so maybe x86-64 is ready for some major simplifications.</p>
<p>In its proposal, Intel describes a new <em>x86S</em> architecture, where <em>S</em> stands for
<em>Simplified</em>.
The simplification mostly consists in the removal of the legacy 16 and 32-bits
modes, in particular Paging will always be enabled on x86S architectures.
This will mostly impact initialization of and booting sequences, completely
voiding the need for legacy 16-bits trampoline code to handle core wakeup.
Indeed, the INIT/SIPI sequence will be modified to directly boot cores in 64
bits mode with pre-selected <code>cr0</code>, <code>cr3</code>, <code>cr4</code>, and <code>rip</code> registers.</p>
<p>The 32-bits mode is not completely going away, as Intel plans to preserve the
32-bits compatibility mode for legacy 32-bits applications, but the mode is not
available for ring 0, while ring 2 and 3 have been completely removed.</p>
<p>Beside the removal of legacy modes, Intel also announced the removal of the
memory-mapped xAPIC in favor of the newer, MSR-based x2APIC.
Once again the xAPIC is not completely going away either, as virtualization
through Intel VMX will still be available.</p>
<p>Overall, those changes should not have too much impact on modern systems, but
the new x86S architecture will definitely make experimenting on x86 platforms
easier.</p>
<h2 id="confidential-computing-in-the-clouds">Confidential Computing in the Clouds</h2>
<p>AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure all announced support for more confidential
computing technologies.
While <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/04/amazon-ec2-amd-sev-snp/">AWS</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/rsa-snp-vm-more-confidential">Google Cloud</a> both introduced support for AMD SEV-SNP,
Azure is <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/confidential-vms-with-intel-tdx-dcesv5-ecesv5/">launching</a> its preview for Intel TDX-backed confidential VMs.</p>
<p>I am not very surprised to see Microsoft adopt the new Intel extension for
confidential computing, considering Azure already had <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/quick-create-portal">extensive support</a>
for Intel SGX enclaves and Microsoft has been heavily communicating about it.
Google is also known for working on confidential computing, notably though their
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/introducing-asylo-an-open-source-framework-for-confidential-computing">Asylo
project</a>,
but they have been a bit shy with their cloud offering and integration compared
to Microsoft.
It is a bit more un-anticipated from AWS, though, as their confidential
computing offering with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/nitro-enclaves/">Nitro
Enclaves</a> is purely software
based and assumes the hypervisor, and by extension AWS, is trusted.
With SEV-SNP AWS is changing its stance toward confidential computing, I am
curious to see what they can come up with next.</p>
<p>The moves toward SEV-SNP and TDX also confirm the trend toward coarse-grained
trusted execution environment, most likely for the sake of compatibility with
existing workload and the ease of integrating confidential VMs in the existing
cloud offering.
Enclave solutions struggled to gain adoption, and with the <a href="https://cdrdv2.intel.com/v1/dl/getContent/634648">already announced</a>
deprecation of SGX on desktop processors they are unlikely to make a comeback
any time soon.</p>
<h2 id="osdi-2023-papers-announced">OSDI 2023 Papers Announced</h2>
<p>The OSDI 2023 program has been <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi23/technical-sessions">released</a>, and with it the abstract of accepted papers.
OSDI is one of the main academic system conference, which will take place in
Boston this year.
There seems to be a lot of interesting papers for this edition, I am personally looking
forward for the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/presentation/zhou-zhe">userspace bypass</a>
and <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi23/presentation/zhou-ziqiao">core
slicing</a>
papers,
while some other specimens like a <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi23/presentation/albab">by design RGPD-complient SDL
database</a> are
piquing my interest.</p>
