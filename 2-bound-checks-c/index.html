        <p>In this second issue we are taking a look at an interesting bound check
extension proposal for C, the new Rust release, and enlightening article about
the history of SAT solver. Finally, this week HotOS is taking place in
providence.</p>
<h2 id="bound-checking-in-c">Bound Checking in C</h2>
<p>A new RFC for adding bound checks to C has <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-enforcing-bounds-safety-in-c-fbounds-safety/70854">landed in LLVM</a>.
C is famous for being memory unsafe, which is the cause of 70% of bugs in both
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/chrome-70-of-all-security-bugs-are-memory-safety-issues/">Chrome</a>
and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-70-percent-of-all-security-bugs-are-memory-safety-issues/">Microsoft's
products</a>,
adding bound checks to C is an attempt to eliminate some of those bugs.</p>
<p>The RFC proposes two extensions: an ABI compatible <code>__counted_by</code> annotation,
and an ABI breaking wide pointer. The <code>__counted_by</code> annotation has the
advantage of being compatible with existing code, and easy to ignore for
compilers that do not support the extension, but requires manual annotation in
the function signature. The idea is pretty simple: when a function takes a
pointer and a maximum size, the annotation tells the compiler that the second
parameter should be used for bound checks. Here is an example of using the
extension (taken from the RFC):</p>
<pre data-lang="c" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-c "><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#b48ead;">void </span><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">fill_array_with_indices</span><span>(</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">int </span><span>*</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">__counted_by</span><span>(count) </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">p</span><span>, size_t </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">count</span><span>) {  
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#65737e;">// off-by-one error   
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">for </span><span>(size_t i = </span><span style="color:#d08770;">0</span><span>; i &lt;= count; ++i)  
</span><span>        p[i] = i;  
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Because retro-fitting an entire app with manual annotation can be tedious, the
RFC also propose to introduce wide pointers. A wide pointer is simply a pointer
with a bound, Rust already <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/exotic-sizes.html#dynamically-sized-types-dsts">use them
extensively</a> for bound checking of types with dynamic sizes.
This extension, however, is ABI breaking. Only future will tell if this is an
acceptable trade-off for adding a bit more of memory safety to C.</p>
<p>Another interesting proposal in this RFC is sentinel-delimited arrays. C often
use the null byte as a sentinel, for instance in strings, rather than explicitly
passing a size. The RFC propose another annotation that let the compiler know
that a special value, the sentinel, marks the end of the array. This in turn can
be used for bound-checking. Interestingly, Zig <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.10.1/#Sentinel-Terminated-Arrays">already has sentinel-delimited
arrays</a>
and can use the sentinel it is great to see proposals to port it to C.</p>
<h2 id="rust-1-70">Rust 1.70</h2>
<p>Rust 1.70 <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/06/01/Rust-1.70.0.html">has been released</a>.
The biggest change from a user perspective is the switch to a sparse index for
<code>crate.io</code>. Before, cargo used to fetch and update the whole index once in a
while, an operation that can take minutes. With this change, only part of the
index is required, making the installation of crates much faster.</p>
<p>Another interesting change is the introduction of <code>OnceCell</code> and <code>OnceLock</code>.
Those two construct are used for holding data that must be initialized once.
Initialization of global data is a recurrent problem in Rust, so it is good to
have a solution backed-in the standard library.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>OnceLock</code> is not available for <code>no_std</code> targets (because it uses
a lock), and <code>OnceCell</code> is <code>!Sync</code> (not sync), meaning that it can't shared by
threads or being used as a static. Therefore, bare metal programmers will have
to continue to rely on external crates, such as <a href="https://crates.io/crates/lazy_static">lazy_static</a> for global data initialization. </p>
<h2 id="the-silent-r-evolution-of-sat">The Silent (R)evolution of SAT</h2>
<p>Last week I stumbled upon a very interesting in the Communications of the ACM:
<a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2023/6/273222-the-silent-revolution-of-sat/pdf">the silent (r)evolution of
SAT</a>.
The article is a good introduction to SAT solvers, and explains the evolutions
that happened in the field during those last few decades.</p>
<p>SAT solvers are playing an increasingly important role in systems. Indeed, SAT
solvers are a crucial building block for formal verification, but it is also
increasingly common to have an SAT solver as an integral part of a system.
A notable example is AWS, which rely on SAT solvers for both internal
verification and <a href="https://www.amazon.science/blog/a-billion-smt-queries-a-day">customer facing
products</a>.
Maybe SAT solvers will soon become an indispensable tool for system designers?</p>
<h2 id="hotos-23">HotOS'23</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2023/">HotOS workshop</a> is taking
place this week, with <a href="https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2023/zoom.html">free remote
attendance</a>.
HotOS is a workshop for sharing new ideas about OS research, the program is
available <a href="ttps://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2023/program.html">here</a> and
spawns a wide range of subjects from OS design to hardware, security,
application development, caching, and more.
I will be presenting some of my work there on <a href="https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2023/papers/castes.pdf">Creating Trust by Abolishing
Hierarchies</a></p>
